****NOTE: None of ISC's projects are open source. So, I am not able to share the code which I have written in this project.**
#### Introduction
IIP is Central Bank of Iran’s newest inter-bank payment system. IIP services are available all-around-the clock and should result in the immediate or close to immediate crediting of the Beneficiary’s account. The project is based on **microservice** architecture.

#### My Responsibilites
1. Developed a **Socket.IO** client based on Spring Boot for pre-defined communication between IIP and consumer banks. The client receives from and send messages to consumer banks using **IBM MQ** and communicates with Socket.IO server.
2. Developed a terminal for real-time communication between the **Angular** application and the server’s command line using **WebSocket** and **Xterm.js**.
3. **Netflix Zuul** gateway implementation for receving messages from clients based on REST endpoints and delivering them to destination services using **Apache Kafka**. For service discovery, **Eureka** server is used. [```[Source Code]```](https://github.com/Abradat/inbound-gateway){:target="_blank"}
